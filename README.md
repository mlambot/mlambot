- 👋 Hi, I’m Dr Marie-Alexandra Lambot
- 👀 I’m originally a pathologist, now a terminology and classification expert involved in SNOMED CT and FHIR development and implementation and coordinating the Belgian Community Support for Clinical Terminologies (CSCT), a Belgian healthcare standardization and structuration sharing community. I'm interested in SNOMED CT, creating HL7 FHIR ressources, exploiting healthcare data, ICD10CM/PCS coding and ICD11 and in educating anyone who needs to know about it. I'm co-chair of SNOMED international Allergy CRG and involved there also in SNOMED CT translation group and SNOMED on FHIR.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning my way in FHIR.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on clinical data logical models, SNOMED CT value sets for these models, improving SNOMED CT terminology and FHIR ressources to fit the needs of the field in Belgium and beyond, and to create SNOMED CT adapted FHIR ressources.
- 📫 How to reach me: Throught our Belgian Community Support for Clinical Terminologies (CSCT) sharing community at info@csct.be and https://csct.be/helpdesk
